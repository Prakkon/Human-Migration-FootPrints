# Human Migration Patterns


#### Introduction

A project that started as a course assignment submission and took a turn towards passion as I dug deeper into the subject. There are a lot of cool facts I plan to unravel as I evolve my visualization skills and knowledge of the topic.

I'll be adding patch notes with time for each commit as long as I feel there's room for improvement (at the time of it's creation, yes, there's a lot of room!)
