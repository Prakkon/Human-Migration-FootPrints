# Human Migration Patterns


#### Introduction

A project that started as a course assignment submission and took a turn towards passion as I dug deeper into the subject. There are a lot of cool facts I plan to unravel as I evolve my visualization skills and knowledge of the topic.

I'll be adding patch notes with time for each commit as long as I feel there's room for improvement (at the time of it's creation, yes, there's a lot of room!)

### Future Plans

1) Clean Data
2) Add more visualizations!
  a. add a 3-D globe encompassing human movements over the past 1 century
  b. Map-wide tableau dashboard
  c. Mapping historic events, consequences of the movements in a story mode!
3) Agent Training to predict human movements based on certain factors
4) Link to Human Trafficking (forced migration) index
